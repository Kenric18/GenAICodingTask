### **Brief Overview**  
The solution processes PDF documents to extract key information efficiently, with capabilities for OCR, language detection, translation (if needed), summarization, and question answering. It can handle individual files or batch-process all PDFs in a default folder. The extracted information is saved in a structured JSON format.

### **Tools Used**  
1. **OCR:**  
   - **Tesseract** via `pytesseract` for extracting text from scanned PDFs.  
   - **OpenCV** for image preprocessing to enhance OCR accuracy.  

2. **Language Detection:**  
   - **langdetect** to determine the language of the extracted text.  

3. **Translation:**  
   - **Helsinki-NLP's MarianMT** (via `transformers`) for multilingual text translation to English.  

4. **Question Answering:**  
   - **BERT (bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad)** for extracting answers to specific queries about the document content.  

5. **Summarization:**  
   - **BART-based summarizer** (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) to generate concise summaries of the document.  

6. **General Utilities:**  
   - **PDF2Image:** Converts PDF pages to images for OCR.  
   - **NumPy** and **Pillow (PIL):** For image manipulation.  
   - **PyTorch:** Backend for NLP models.  

### **Assumptions**  
1. **Input Format:**  
   - The input is a valid PDF file. If running in batch mode, PDFs are located in the `BE_GAZETTE_PDFS` folder.  

2. **Text Content:**  
   - The extracted text contains the necessary information (e.g., company name, document purpose).  

3. **Document Quality:**  
   - The PDF is of sufficient quality for OCR to detect text accurately.  

4. **Pre-trained Models:**  
   - BERT and BART models are general-purpose and may require fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks.  

5. **Language Translation:**  
   - The system assumes all non-English languages can be translated accurately to English using MarianMT.  

6. **Environment Setup:**  
   - Tesseract OCR is installed and configured correctly on the system.  
   - The system has a CUDA-enabled GPU for better performance, though it can run on CPU with reduced efficiency.  

This modular solution is designed to handle diverse use cases and document structures with flexibility and scalability.
